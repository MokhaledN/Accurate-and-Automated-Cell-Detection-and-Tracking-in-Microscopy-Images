# Accurate-and-Automated-Cell-Detection-and-Tracking-in-Microscopy-Images

## Overview

This repository hosts the code and resources for our research on automated cell detection and tracking in microscopy images. Our work addresses the persistent challenge in biotechnology and biomedical research of reliably detecting and tracking cells. By leveraging a fine-tuned YOLOv8x model for cell detection and integrating it with the DeepSORT tracking algorithm, we significantly enhance detection recall and reduce ID switches, providing a robust tool for analyzing cellular processes.

## Demo Videos for Cell Detection Models

This repository contains demo videos that illustrate the performance improvements during the cell detection phase using three different models. Each video demonstrates the capabilities of:

- **Original YOLOv8x Model**
- **Fine-Tuned YOLOv8x Model**
- **Integrated Pipeline with DeepSORT**
